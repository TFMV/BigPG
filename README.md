# 🎉 Welcome to BigPG! 🚀

BigPG is your go-to FastAPI app for effortlessly moving data from Google BigQuery to PostgreSQL. Whether you're dealing with small datasets or massive tables, BigPG has got you covered with powerful data streaming capabilities powered by Apache Arrow.

## 🔥 Features

- **Speedy Transfers:** Blast your data from BigQuery to PostgreSQL in no time.
- **Memory-Efficient:** Stream Arrow record batches directly for those hefty datasets.
- **Flexibility:** Apply filters to your data with custom predicates.
- **Schema-Aware:** Automatically generates metadata to keep you informed about your data structure.

## ⚙️ Configuration

BigPG needs a config.yaml to know where to find your BigQuery and PostgreSQL databases. Here’s what it should look like:

```yaml
gcp:
  project_id: "your_gcp_project_id"
  credentials_file: "/path/to/your/gcp/credentials.json"

postgres:
  conn_str: "postgresql://postgres:password@localhost/databasename"
```
